using Conda
#===============================================================================
NOTE: pyxid is a conda package I built from a PyPI package,
following the directions at https://conda.io/docs/build_tutorials/pkgs.html.

This process requried one small modification for the package to work on windows.
I had to change the file meta.yaml generated by `conda skeleton pypi pyxid`
to contain the following.

    preserve_egg_dir: True
===============================================================================#
Conda.add_channel("haberdashPI"); Conda.add("pyxid")
